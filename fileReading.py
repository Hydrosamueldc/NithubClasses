      THE RULE OF GAME 
  The game is played by two players, you and computer.
  Each player starts with a certain number of life points  10.
  On each turn, the players choose one of the four elements: Fire, Water, Earth, or Air.
  The element matchups follow the rule: Fire beats Earth, Water beats Fire, Earth beats Water, and Air beats Earth.
  If both players choose the same element, it results in a tie for that round.
  After each round, the winner deals damage to the opponent equal to the difference in life points.
  The game continues until one player's life points reach zero.
  At the end of the game, the player with remaining life points is declared the winner.
  The computer's choice of element can be randomly determined.
  Provide prompts and feedback to guide the player through the game, such as displaying the choices made, 
  the outcome of each round, and the remaining life points.
